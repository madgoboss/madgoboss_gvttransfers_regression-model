Project 1: Government Transfer - Predictive Model

I am high school student that is passionate about data science and analysis. This is a mini, self-initiated project that I am doing in my freetime! I am using previous data to predict the per capita goverment transfer to Singaporeans in the upcoming years! I also hope to find any other cool inights!

Data is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore
