Project 1: Government Transfer - Predictive Model

I am high school student that is passionate about data science and analysis. This is a mini, self-initiated project that I am doing in my freetime, where I try to predict the per capita goverment transfer to the residents of Singapore for the upcoming years! 
Data is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore
