Project 1: Government Transfers - Predictive Model using Linear Regression

I am a high school student who is passionate about data science and analysis. This is a mini, self-initiated project that I am doing during my freetime! I am using previous data to predict the per capita goverment transfers to Singaporeans based on their type of housing. I also hope to find cool insights from the data!

Data is obtained from Department of Statistics Singapore
